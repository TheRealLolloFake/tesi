	\section{Constrained node network}
	A constrained device is small, has low computational power and little memory.
	Basically, it lacks the resources that we could expect from a basic Internet node.\newline
	Optimization of power consumption and bandwidth is extremely important; even the maximum code complexity and the maximum RAM available must be taken into account.\newline
	When a constrained device is attached to a network it is identified as a constrained node, lots of constrained nodes form a network that may have some constraint such as: unreliability, lossy channel, dynamic topology and unpredictable bandwidth.\newline
	A constrained network is characterized by: low bandwidth, high packet loss and asymmetric link characteristics, absence of multicast communication and high penalties in using large packets.\newline
	A network is called constrained-node network when the constraints are imposed by the node.

	A constrained device belongs to one of classes described in table \ref{tab:table1}.\newline

	A device can also be classified from the point of view of energy consumption as illustrated in table \ref{tab:table2}.
	
	The main sources of energy consumption are: wireless communication and long communication; in order to save as much energy as possible different strategies could be applied in different scenarios.\newline
	If there is no need for extreme power saving a device could be always on, in this case it is necessary to use power friendly hardware in order to avoid wastes of energy and money.\newline
	In other cases a device could be off most of time and it will wake up only when needed, in this case the wake up and the reconnection the network
	could be costly from an energy point of view, but it is considered a good trade off.\newline
	It is also possible that a device has low power consumption as it can operate with small amount of power; in this case it is a special case of an always on device.
