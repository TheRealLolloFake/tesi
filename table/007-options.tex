				If this Option is missing and a payload is included, no default value is assumed.\\\hline
				
				ETag & Specifies an entity-tag, it is a local identifier for the same resource that may vary over time.
				It is generated by the server that provides the resource.
				The entity-tag can be crafted in different way: version, checksum, hash or time.
				The client that receives an ETag must make no assumptions about it.
				If used as a response Option it provides the current value of the entity-tag.
				On the other hand if it is used as a GET request option, it is used to select one or more representation.\\\hline
				
				Location-Path & to do\\\hline
				
				Location-Query & to do\\\hline
				
				Max-Age &	Specifies the maximum time a response may be cached before it is considered not fresh.
				The value is an integer between 0 and $2^32-1$, the default value is 60 seconds.\\\hline
				
				Proxy-Uri & It is used to perform a request to a forward-proxy.
				If an endpoint receives a request with a Proxy-Uri Option and it is not capable to act as forward-proxy it must send back a 5.05 response.
				It must take precedence over any Uri-Host, Uri-Port, Uri-Path or Uri-Query.
				They must not be included in a request that has the Proxy-Uri Option.\\\hline
				
				Proxy-Scheme & to do\\\hline
